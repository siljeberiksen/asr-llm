# Experiment 19

## Model used

Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q6_K_L.gguf

## Dataset

Utilzing NPSC 3

## Hyperparameters

- beam size = 5
- context size = 10

## Prompt

You are an ASR transcript selector.
Perform language model rescoring based on the top-5 outputs generated by an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system given a conversational history.
Select the most accurate ASR transcription and provide the best possible corrected version if necessary.

---

## History: [conversational history]

The ASR hypotheses are as follows:
Option 1 [hypothesis 1]
Option 2 [hypothesis 2]
Option 3 [hypothesis 3]
Option 4 [hypothesis 4]
Option 5 [hypothesis 5]

Output the best transcription as a plain string, making minimal corrections if necessary for accuracy and fluency, ensuring it follows the larger conversational history.
Always answer in Norwegian.
