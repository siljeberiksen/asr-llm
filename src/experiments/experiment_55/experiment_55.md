# Experiment 55

## Model used

Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q6_K_L.gguf

## Dataset

Utilzing NPSC 3

## Hyperparameters

- beam size = 10
- context size = 10

## Prompt

### Prompt for LLM

You are an ASR transcript selector,
Perform language model rescoring based on the top-10 outputs generated by an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system given a conversational history,
Select the most accurate ASR transcription,

---

[Conversational history]

---

The ASR hypotheses are as follows:
<option1> [hypothesis 1] </option1>
<option2> [hypothesis 2] </option2>
<option3> [hypothesis 3] </option3>
<option4> [hypothesis 4] </option4>
<option5> [hypothesis 5] </option5>
...

Reason concisely about the correct ASR transcription using past conversational history, and output the integer index N of the most suitable ASR transcription from the <option N> hypothesis
