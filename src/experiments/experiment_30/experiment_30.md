# Experiment 30

## Model used

Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q6_K_L.gguf

## Dataset

Utilzing NPSC 3

## Hyperparameters

- beam size = 5
- context size = 100

## Prompt

You are an ASR transcript selector,
Perform language model rescoring based on the top-5 outputs generated by an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system given a conversational history,
Select the most accurate ASR transcription and provide the best possible corrected version if necessary,

---

## History: [conversational history]

The ASR hypotheses are as follows:
Option 1 [hypothesis 1]
Option 2 [hypothesis 2]
Option 3 [hypothesis 3]
Option 4 [hypothesis 4]
Option 5 [hypothesis 5]

---

Follow these steps to determine the correct transcription:

- Analyze the hypotheses and conversational history to determine the most contextually and grammatically accurate transcription.
- Make only minimal corrections when necessary to ensure accuracy and fluency.
- Avoid repetition of previous statements or getting stuck on the same sentence structure. - Do not use emojis in your response.

Output a concise reasoning for the best ASR transcription following steps above, and the final transcription as plaintext.

Always answer in Norwegian.
