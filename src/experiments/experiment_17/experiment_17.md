# Experiment 10

## Model used

Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q6_K_L.gguf

## Dataset

Utilzing NPSC 3

## Hyperparameters

- beam size = 5
- context size = 100

## Prompt

You are an ASR transcript selector.
Perform language model rescoring based on the top-5 outputs generated by an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system given a conversational history.
Select the most accurate ASR transcription.

History: [conversational history]

The ASR hypotheses are as follows:
<option1> [hypothesis 1] </option1>
<option2> [hypothesis 2] </option2>
<option3> [hypothesis 3] </option3>
<option4> [hypothesis 4] </option4>
<option5> [hypothesis 5] </option5>

Output the integer index N of the most suitable ASR transcription from the <option N> hypothesis.
